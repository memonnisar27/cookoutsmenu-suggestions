# Menu Suggestion Tool  

This project is a simple web-based tool that suggests menu items based on user preferences. Users can select dietary preferences and meal types, and the tool provides tailored suggestions by reading a menu from a file.  

## Features  
- Read menu data from a JSON file.  
- Filter menu items based on dietary preferences (e.g., Vegetarian, Vegan).  
- Suggest meals based on selected meal types (e.g., Fast Food, Italian).  
- Includes a link to [Cookout's Menu](https://cookoutsmenu.com) for additional menu exploration.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Flask (`pip install flask`)  

### Setup  
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.  
2. Place your menu data in a `menu.json` file in the root directory.  

### Running the Project  
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.  
2. Run the command:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  
3. Open your browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  

### Menu Data Format  
Ensure your `menu.json` file follows this format:  
```json  
[  
    {"name": "Chicken Burger", "type": "Fast Food", "diet": "Non-Vegetarian"},  
    {"name": "Veggie Salad", "type": "Healthy", "diet": "Vegetarian"},  
    {"name": "Pasta Alfredo", "type": "Italian", "diet": "Vegetarian"},  
    {"name": "Spicy Tacos", "type": "Mexican", "diet": "Non-Vegetarian"},  
    {"name": "Fruit Smoothie", "type": "Healthy", "diet": "Vegan"}  
]  
```  

## Features in the Interface  
- Users can select their preferences for diet and meal type.  
- A random suggestion matching the criteria will be displayed.  
- Visit [Cookout's Menu](https://cookoutsmenu.com) directly for more menu ideas.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add support for reading menu data from CSV or databases.  
- Integrate advanced filters (e.g., by calorie count, spice level).  
- Enhance UI with images and more interactive elements.
